                <p id="biograph">
                  My name is William Sears, I am a web developer based in Oxfordshire, UK.
                  I am currently studying on a Web Development course run by Netmatters;
                  the course teaches the fundamental skills required for a career in Web Development
                  in a very comprehensive manner. <br> <br> I find this area of study greatly fulfilling,
                  as I am able to complete projects that are creatively stimulating,
                  that also require an eye for detail and an aptitude for problem solving.
                  In 2013, I graduated from Oxford Brookes University with a first class degree in Music.
